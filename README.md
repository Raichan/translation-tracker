# Translation Tracker

A counter tool with multiple, customizable counters. Originally built for tracking translation requests for different languages at Pokémon World Championships and other international Pokémon card game & video game tournaments.

Built with MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js.

## Status

Sort of a minimum viable product, does what it's supposed to but could use plenty of improvements, including but not limited to:

- Automatic login on page refresh
- More modern way to edit used languages
- Smoother mobile UI

## Demo

Hopefully coming soon.
